### Authentication
E-Rentify employs a robust user authentication system to ensure secure access to the platform. We have integrated Google OAuth for a seamless and convenient login experience, allowing users to sign in using their Google accounts with just a few clicks. Additionally, we have implemented password hashing to enhance the security of user credentials. This means that user passwords are stored in an encrypted format, making it significantly harder for unauthorized parties to access sensitive information

### User Authentication
image processing technology authenticates users by matching freshly captured images with information.

To further ensure the authenticity of users, we have incorporated a registration form that includes an image input. This image is later used for facial authentication when a user requests a vehicle, confirming that the person making the request is indeed the registered user
